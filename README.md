# ECE-VDTDA
# Efficient and Cost-Effective Vehicle Detection and Tracking with Driver Assistance (ECE-VDTDA)
This repository contains the implementation of ECE-VDTDA systems vehicle detection, tracking, collision avoidance, and driver assistance code, as described in the paper "ECE-VDTDA: A Robust and Computationally
Efficient Collision Avoidance System for Driver Assistance in Foggy Weather".

# Usage
Run distance_TTC_based_warning_with_graphs.py to reproduce results for distance based TTC collision warnings with graphs.  
Run speed_TTC_based_warning_with_graphs.py to reproduce results for speed based TTC collision warnings with graphs.  
Requirements: See requirements.txt file
